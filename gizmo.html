Through this mildly annoying yet loving interaction, we hope to fill the human psychological need of being wanted in this ever isolating society.</p1><br/><br/>
              <p1> It has a soft white body made of silicone which resembles a juicy and meaty bun - hence the name NIKU(ニク: meat in Japanese).</p1></div><br/>

              <div class="left-align">
                <p1>NIKU's movements are directed by the proximity reading from its eyes (an ultrasonic sensor). The void loop () logics are as follows ↓ </p1>
                <br/><br/>
                <p1>• If the distance reading > 80cm, arduino sends PWM output to the left DC motor to drive left wheel foward - NIKU rotates to the right to search for targets around it.</p1>
                <br/>
                <p1>• If the distance reading < 80cm but > 5cm,  arduino sends alternating PWM signals to 2 DC wheels - NIKU moves forward with one wheel driving forward at a time.</p1>
                <br>
                <p1>• If the reading < 5cm, arduino first sends forward signals to drive both DC motors forward and then sends reverse signals to both - NIKU charges forward and then reverse.</p1>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <div class="left-align">
              <p1>The main challenges we faced throughout this project was to concurrently explore both form and mechatronics and then integrate the two together. Also, a tight time frame meant that we had to make compromises and prioritizations. </p1><br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div class="left-align">
              <p1>The initial concept was to create a soft robotic that is sluggish and latches on human foot. However, this concept was rather unrealistic due to the time contraints.</p1><br/>
              <p1>Instead of diving into soft robotics (which is a difficult task for a 3-week project), a soft outter shell with electronic internal hardware is sufficient to achieve our desired behaviours on the robot.</p1><br/><br/>
            </div>
            <img class="scroll" src="img/gizmo/gizmo-moodboard.jpg"><br/><sub>Moodboard at concept stage</sub><br/><br/><br/>

            <div class="left-align">
              <p1>Hence, NIKU's form design and internal hardware engineering were revolved around three key behaviours that we narrowed down to - clumsy, clingy and annoying.</p1><br/>
              <p1>We made rapid prototypes to test out different sensors (IR, Ultrasonic, Thermal) and to experiment with a variety of moving mechanics (vibration, airflow, 2WD, 3WD, 4WD). We also concurrently tested out different orientations for the physical appearance of the robot.</p1><br/><br/>

            <sub>Rapid and efficient experiments on moving mechanics and forms</sub><br/><br/><br/>

            <div class="left-align">
              <p1>After lots of rapid prototyping and iterations, we decided to drive NIKU with the following setup and made work-like prototypes to test out form factors and functionalities (arduino codes).</p1><br/><br/>

              <p1>• Dome-shaped silicone soft case: To give the robot a soft and squishy look. It also provides enough space to hide the internal hardware for a clean and minimal look.</p1>
              <br/>
              <p1>• 3D printed dome-shaped hard case and base plate: The hard case helps to maintain the dome shape (since our silicone is too soft) and the base plate is there to host all internal electronic parts.</p1>
              <br/>
              <p1>• 1 Arduino: The brain of the robot.</p1>
              <br/>
              <p1>• 2 DC motors attached to 2 3D printed wheels seperately: This allows NIKU to move on a left-right-left-right rythm which creates the clumsy character; it also enables NIKU to change directions without the need for a servo motor and a third wheel. </p1>
              <br>
              <p1>• 1 Ultrasonic sensor: Less of a chance to be distracted by environment unlike IR sensor and sound sensor - great for live demonstration. </p1>
              <br/>
              <p1>• 1 Motor H-bridge: To control the speed and direction of the DC motors.</p1>
              <br/>
              <p1>• 1 Ball pen tip: This surprised a lot of people. Essentially, the ball pen tip acts as a free rolling wheel at the front. </p1>
              <br/><br/>

              <p1>We made work-like prototypes to test out form factors and functionalities (arduino codes).</p1><br/><br/>
            </div><br/>
            <img class="scroll" src="img/gizmo/gizmo-hardware-iteration.jpg"><br/><sub>To test out hardwares and codes, we teared down a toy 3WD car and soldered our own parts onto it for a rapid work-like prototype</sub><br/><br/><br/>

            <div class="left-align">
              <p1>We then finalised on the internal hardware and the exterior design; and started 3D printing the mold (for silicone case) and the exterior casing.</p1><br/><br/>

            <div class="left-align">
              <p1>For a 3-week project, we were happy that NIKU was able to achieve all the key functionalities and movements.  The live demo was successful - everyone loved NIKU!</p1><br/><br/>

              <img class="scroll" src="img/gizmo/gizmo-gif-3.gif"><br/><sub>NIKU and I doing live demo</sub><br/><br/>
            <div class="left-align">
              <p1> However, since we really wanted NIKU to be chasing human foot exclusively, we needed to add computer vision. Hence, we decided to make further development where we swapped the arduino board out for a more powerful raspberry pi to unlock object detection.</p1><br/><br/>
