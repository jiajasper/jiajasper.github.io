      <description>This is an exploration project on making AR experience more accessible to the Vision Impaired People (VIP).
Through this project I learnt about inclusive design and picked up new skills such as developing AR content on Web with WebXR and AR.js (Aframe).
Working closely with VIP was also an invaluable experience where I learnt that designer should be designing WITH the users as opposed to designing FOR the users.
What is AR Problem Current Barriers How do VIP use their iphones?</description>
